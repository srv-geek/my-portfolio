            <strong>Spring Boot</strong> and optimized REST APIs.
          </p>

            Beyond coding, Iâ€™m passionate about
            <strong>hiking and photography</strong>â€”capturing life through my
            lens fuels my creativity. I also enjoy
            <strong>playing cricket and exploring music</strong>, finding
